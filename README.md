# Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge

## Motivation
* Mainy the High Precision smartphone positioning is helpful for many novel application such as geo-surveying , Entertaining Precision agriculture , Precise AR and Etc .
* But i was working on [autonomous delivery system](https://github.com/kartikeyshaurya/DistroBot) and the robots will be small and we required the precise geolocation of the robot to map the lane and also moniter the traffic and other application.

## Overview of the Challenge 

*   hosted by Android GPS team , and presented at the ION GNSS 2021 Conference .
* The aim of organisation is to the advance research in smartphone GNSS positioning accuracy and help people better navigate the world around them .
